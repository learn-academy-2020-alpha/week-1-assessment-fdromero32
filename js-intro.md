# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a tool used by programmers to store information. Think of them as the "tupper wear" of code. They are able to store different data types that can execute what we need them to. You can use them to run multiple pieces of code without need to rewrite that particular code every time. The input would be the only thing that would need to be changed, and your function would execute what you coded it to do for you.

  Researched answer:  A function is a JavaScript procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it, list the parameters of the function, enclosed in parenthesis (unless only 1 parameter in ES6, not necessary) and then define the function using curly brackets. You can then use the return key word to specify the value returned by the function.



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Both are higher order functions that can lessen the amount of code you write. The .map() function mutates your array by looping through and creates a new array based on the conditions you provide. The .filter() function creates a new array that filters out elements in the array that do not meet the criteria provided.

  Researched answer: The .map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. It does not change the original array. The .filter() method creates an array filled with all the array elements that pass a test (provided as a funciton). does not change the original array - WS3school website.


3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: Console.log() is a tool for programmers to test for bugs in their code and see that the input they want is actually happening. This is mainly a tool for us that the client wouldn't see. Return executes your function but doesn't log it as console.log() would. Once we use return, anything after that section of the code (in the brackets {}) wouldn't run anymore since it stops the function from executing.

  Researched answer: console.log() was pretty on point. Essentially a tool used for debugging and for us to see our output. From MDN website: The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is what you pass through your function to execute the code written within. It can be simple data types or other functions.

  Researched answer: So parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Arguments are the real values (inputs we type in) that are passed/received by the function - W3school.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: One person is the driver and the other is the eyes(?). You have another brain to help you through you code. You are able to communicate freely and efficiently to get your product completed.

  Researched answer: The other person, not driving, is called the 'navigator'. It is important for both parties to switch roles every couple of minutes in order to both experience the roles. It has shown to work in the programming world by increasing efficiency in code quality.


6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: Top Down Directory? Its for languages like JavaScript/HTML/CSS that read from top to bottom.

  Researched answer: TDD actually stands for Test Driven Development (TDD) and not Top Down Directory. It essentially the testing with Jest mentality. We test to ensure that the function would pass the Red, Green, Refactor jest test screen. It is the reverse logic of writing a code first and debugging second.

7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: The password generator project. I think that doing something more complex that we learn is a great challenge that pushes us to do better. Also the fact that we get to do it with a partner serves as a great learning experience for both parties.
